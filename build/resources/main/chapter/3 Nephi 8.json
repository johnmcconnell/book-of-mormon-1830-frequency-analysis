I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the father to speak unto you at this time; therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand; and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again. But now I go unto the Father, and also to shew myself unto the lost tribes of Israel: for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.",

And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and beheld he prayed unto the Father; and the things which he prayed, cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record which heard him. And after this manner do they bear record; the eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvellous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father; and no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvellous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which",
