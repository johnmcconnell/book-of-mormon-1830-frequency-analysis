And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness, to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore, they wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days, did they wander. And when they had wandered forty days, they came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their tents. And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of Nephi; and behold, they met the",

Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna, that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them. And again: That same God hath brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and hath kept and preserved his people, even until now. And behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations, that has brought us into bondage. -- And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom, and the land round about; and all this he done, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection, or into bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks, and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess. the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives. And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our afflictions great? Now behold, how great reason have we to mourn. Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn: for behold, how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood hath been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.

And a Prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which is to come, yea, even the coming of Christ. And because he saith unto them, That Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and saith that he should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth; and now, because he said this, they put him to death; and many more things did they do, which brought down the wrath of God upon them. Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions? For behold, the Lord hath said, I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways, that they prosper not, and their doing shall be as a stumbling block before them. And again, He saith, If my people shall sow filthiness, they shall reap the chaff thereof, in the whirlwind; and the effects thereof is poison, And again: He saith, If my people shall sow filthiness, they shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.

And for a testimony that the things that they have said is true, they have brought twenty-four plates, which are filled with engravings; and they are of pure gold.
