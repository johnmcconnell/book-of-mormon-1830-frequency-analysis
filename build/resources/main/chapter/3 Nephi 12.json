And now there cannot be written in this book, even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people; but behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things which he taught the people; and these things have I written, which are a lesser part of the things which he taught the people; and I have wrote them to the intent that they may be brought again unto this people, from the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken. -- And when they shall have received this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith: And if it shall so be that they shall believe these things, then shall the greater things be made manifest unto them. And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the greater things be withheld from them, unto their condemnation. Behold I were about to write them all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbid it, saying, I will try the faith of my people; therefore I, Mormon, do write the things which have been commanded me of the Lord. And now I Mormon, make an end of my sayings, and proceed to write the things which have been commanded me; therefore I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space of three days; and after that, he did shew himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and gave it unto them.",

And it came to pass that after he had ascended into Heaven the second time that he shewed himself unto them, and gone unto the Father, after having healed all their sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of their blind, and unstopped the ears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of cures among them, and raised a man from the dead, and had shewn forth his power unto them, and had ascended unto the Father, behold, it came to pass on the morrow, that the multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths, and utter marvellous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden, that there should not any man write",

And it came to pass that the disciples whom Jesus had chosen, began from that time forth to baptize and to teach as many as did come unto them; and as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus, were filled with the Holy Ghost. And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful to be written; and they taught, and did minister one to another; and they had all things common among them, every man dealing justly, one with another. And it came to pass that they did do all things, even as Jesus had commanded them. And they which were baptized in the name of Jesus, were called the church of Christ.",

And Jesus again shewed himself unto them: for they were praying unto the Father, in his name; and Jesus came and stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, What will ye that I shall give unto you? And they said unto him, Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people concerning this matter. And the Lord said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, why is it that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing? have they not read the scriptures, which saith ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is in my name? for by this name shall ye be called at the last day; and whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day; therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my name, that he will bless the church for my sake; and how be it my church, save it be called in my name? for if a church be called in Moses\u0027 name, then it be Moses\u0027 church: or if it be called in the name of a man, then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name, then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my Gospel. Verily, I say unto you, that ye are built upon my Gospel; therefore ye shall call whatsoever things ye do call in my name; therefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be in my name, the Father will hear you; and if it so be that the church is built upon my Gospel, then will the Father shew forth his own works in it; but if it be not built upon my Gospel, and is built",

Behold I have given unto you my Gospel, and this is the Gospel which I have given unto you: That I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me; and my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I have been lifted up upon the cross, I might draw all men unto me; that as I have been lifted up by men, even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil; and for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father, I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works. And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name, shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father, at that day when I shall stand to judge the world. And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father; and this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words; and no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest, save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end. Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day. Verily, verily I say unto you, this is my Gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do, that shall ye also do; for the works which ye have seen me do, even that shall ye do; therefore if ye do these things, blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted up at the last day.",
