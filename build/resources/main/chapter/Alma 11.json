And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla; there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years; even until the fifth day of the second month, in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land; for behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in on the wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of Ammonihah, and began to slay the people, and to destroy the city.",

And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren which had been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them which had been lost, that were taken captive. And they were brought by their brethren to possess their own lands. And thus ended the eleventh year of the Judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites were destroyed , and also their great city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness. -- But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and their carcases were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness; nevertheless, after many days, their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof, that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years. And it was called desolation of Nehors; for they were of the profession of Nehor, which were slain; and their lands remained desolate. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.",

And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the word of God, without any respects of persons continually. And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more which had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout the land. And the establishment of the Church became general throughout all the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.",

And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness. And now after the Church having been established throughout the land, having got the victory over the Devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land; and the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the people; and thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the Judges, over the people of Nephi.",
