And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings, he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold, ye have heard these things which I have taught before I ascended to my Father; therefore whoso remembereth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, him will I raise up at the last day. And it came to pass that when Jesus had said these words, he perceived that there were some among them which marvelled, and wondered what he would concerning the law of Moses: for they understood not the saying, That old things had passed away, and that all things had become knew. And he saith unto them, Marvel not that I said unto you, that old things had passed away, and that all things had become new. Behold I say unto you, That the law is fulfilled that was given unto Moses. Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he which covenanted with my people Israel; therefore, the law in me is fulfilled: for I have come to fulfil the law; therefore, it hath an end. Behold, I do not destroy the prophets: for as many as have not been fulfilled in me, verily, I say unto you, shall all be fulfilled. And because I said unto you, That old things hath passed away, I do not destroy that which hath been spoken concerning things which is to come. For behold, the covenant which I have made with my people, is not all fulfilled; but the law which was given unto Moses, hath an end in me. Behold, I am the law, and the light: Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live: for unto him that endureth to the end, will I give eternal life. Behold, I have given unto you the commandments; therefore keep my commandments. And this is the law and the prophets: for they truly testified of me.",

And now because of stiffneckedness and unbelief, they understood not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning this thing unto them. But, verily, I say unto you, that the Father hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity, that they know not of you. And verily, I say unto you again, That the other tribes hath the father separated from them; and it is because of their iniquity, that they know not of them. And verily, I say unto you, That ye are they of which I said, other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the Gentiles: for they understood not that the Gentiles should be converted through their preaching; and they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice; that I should not manifest myself unto them, save it were by the Holy Ghost. But behold, ye have not heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered among them which the Father hath given me. And verily, verily, I say unto you, That I have other sheep, which are not of this land; neither of the land of Jerusalem; neither in any parts of that land round about, whither I have been to minister. For they of which I speak, are they which have not as yet heard my voice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them. But I have received a commandment of the Father, That I shall go unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be numbered among my sheep, that there may be one fold, and one shepherd; therefore I go to shew myself unto them. And I command you that ye shall write these sayings, after that I am gone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they which have seen",

And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the earth; and then will I fulfil the covenant which the Father hath made unto all the people of the house of Israel. And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their belief in me, in and of the Holy Ghost, which witness unto them of me and of the Father. Behold, because of their belief in me, saith the Father, and because of the unbelief of you, O house of Israel, in the latter day shall the truth come unto the Gentiles, that the fulness of these things shall be made known unto them. But Wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles: for notwithstanding that they come forth upon the face of this land, and have scattered my people, which are of the house of Israel; and my people which are of the house of Israel, have been cast out from among them, and have been trodden under feet by them; and because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the judgments of the Father upon my people, which are of the house of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, That after all this, and I have caused my people which are of the house of Israel, to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to be slain, and to be cast out from among them, and to become hated by them. And thus commandeth the Father that I should say unto you at that day, When the Gentiles shall sin against my Gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my Gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people of the whole earth, and shall be filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs, and all manner of hypocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of secret abominations; and if they shall do all these things and shall reject the fulness of my Gospel, behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of my Gospel from among them; and then will I remember my covenant which I have made unto my people, O house of Israel, and I will bring my Gospel unto them; and I will shew unto thee, O house of Israel,",

And when the words of the prophet Isaiah shall be fulfilled, which saith, Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.
