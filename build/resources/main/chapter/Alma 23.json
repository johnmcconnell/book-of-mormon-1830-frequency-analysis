And now it came to pass, in the commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in peace; nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land",

And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain Chief Judge over the land, took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them: for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights, and privileges of their religion, by a free government.",

Now those which were in favor of kings, were those of high birth; and they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those which sought power and authority over the people. But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites, against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers, from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war, with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni. But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies, to come to battle against the Nephites. Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because of the many thousands which had been slain by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding",

And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceeding wroth, because of the stubborness of those people, of whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceeding wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them. And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the Governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him, (Moroni,) power to compel those dissenters to defend their country, or to put them to death; for it was his first care to put an end to such contentions, and dissentions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction. -- And it came to pass that it was granted, according to the voice of the people.",
