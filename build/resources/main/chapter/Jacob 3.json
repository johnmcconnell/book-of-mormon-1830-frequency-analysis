Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon the plates, hoping that our beloved brethren, and our children, will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them, that they may learn with joy, and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents: for, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory, many hundred years before his coming; and not only we, ourselves, had a hope of his glory, but also all the Holy Prophets which were before us.",
