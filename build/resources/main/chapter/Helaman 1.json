For behold, Pahoran had died and gone all the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment seat among the brethren, which were the sons of Pahoran. Now these are there names which did contend for the judgment seat, which did also cause the people to contend; Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni. Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran, (for he had many,) but these are they which did contend for the judgment seat; therefore they did cause three divisions among the people. Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be a Chief Judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.",

Now when those people which were desirous that he should be their governor, saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry; and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment seat. And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen, that no man could overtake him. And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran; therefore Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen, and his band which was covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found, were condemned unto death. And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice of the people, to be a Chief Judge and a govereor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right.

And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and mighty man; therefore the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron. Now Tubaloth supposing that Coriantumr, he being a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, insomuch with his strength, and also with his great wisdom, that by sending him forth, he should gain power over the Nephites; therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to",

But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such exceeding great speed, that there was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies; therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city. And it came to pass that Pacumeni, which was the Chief Judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city.

And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land; and supposing that their greatest strength was in the centre of the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves together, save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth. But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the centre of the land, gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the numbers of the Nephites which were slain, for behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the centre of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders, as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.
