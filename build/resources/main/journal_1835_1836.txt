The text block consists of 114 leaves—including single flyleaves and pastedowns in the front and back—measuring 12¼ x 8 inches (31 x 20 cm). The 110 interior leaves are ledger paper with thirty-four lines in faint—and now faded—black ink that has turned brown. There are nine gatherings of various sizes—each gathering about a dozen leaves. The text block is sewn all along over cloth tapes. The front and back covers of the journal are pasteboard. The ledger has a tight-back case binding with a brown calfskin quarter-leather binding. The outside covers are adorned in shell marbled paper, with dark green body and veins of light green. The bound volume measures 12⅜ x 8¼ inches (31 x 21 cm) and is 13/16 inches (2 cm) thick. One cover of the book is labeled “Repentence.” in black ink. The first page of ledger paper under that cover contains eight lines of references to the book of Genesis under the heading “Scriptures relating to Repentince”. The spine has “No 8” inscribed upside up when the book is standing upright for this side. When the volume is turned upside down and flipped front to back, the other cover is titled “Sabbath Day” with “No 9” written beneath in black ink. The first page of ledger paper under that cover contains two lines of references to the book of Genesis under the heading “Scriptures relating to the Sabbath day”. Thus the book was used to simultaneously house two volumes of topical notes on biblical passages. This book was apparently part of a larger series that included at least two other extant volumes—one bearing “Faith” and “10” on the cover, and the other bearing “Second Comeing of Christ” and “No 3” on one cover and “Gift of the Holy Ghost” on the other cover. 1 “Grammar & Aphabet of the Egyptian Language,” Kirtland Egyptian Papers, ca. 1835–1836, CHL; Kirtland Elders Quorum, “Record”.   Comprehensive Works Cited Hide Works Cited Kirtland Egyptian Papers, ca. 1835–1836.

Thus empowered, they could better fulfill key elements of their mission: preaching God’s message for the last time throughout the world prior to the imminent Second Coming; gathering converts to Missouri, where they would find safety in Zion from the destruction that was to overtake the wicked; and ministering to the Saints. After a hiatus of more than nine months, JS renewed his journal keeping during this period of organization, purification, and preparation.

It is the last journal that contains JS’s own handwriting: seven entries—four manuscript pages. Entries were sometimes made one or more days after the fact, but an entry was made for every day from the journal’s beginning to its end, providing a continuity lacking in JS’s previous journal and reflecting a time of relative stability for the church in Kirtland. JS is not embattled, defending his people and projects against enemies; rather, he is gathering and preparing his people for what they expect to be a pivotal experience. Blessings, rebukes, and counsel recorded here manifest the hopes and expectations of JS and others in church leadership.

His duties included keeping JS’s journal and minutes of church meetings and copying certain materials into JS’s 1834–1836 history, which Oliver Cowdery had begun the prior year. Parrish’s first recorded journal entry is for 8 October 1835, suggesting that journal keeping was three weeks behind when he started. Parrish inscribed entries covering the next six weeks. The journal was in Parrish’s possession during at least part of the time he was inscribing it, and the practice may have been for the assigned scribe to retain possession during his tenure. JS recorded four reflective entries for December 19–22 and indicated in the last of those entries that Parrish was ill. JS then passed the journal to Williams, whose entries covered four days ending 26 December 1835. Parrish resumed scribal duties for four weeks’ entries, but then his ill health forced him to relinquish journal keeping to Sylvester Smith 25 Mar. 1806–22 Feb. 1880.

(Midvale, UT: Signature Books, 1983–1985). Apparently Parrish’s scribal responsibilities for the journal and for JS’s 1834–1836 history were delegated at this time to Warren Cowdery 17 Oct. 1788–23 Feb. 1851.

Cowdery used the first two months of material from the journal, 22 September to 18 November 1835, as the basis for a new section of the 1834–1836 history and also wrote the final two entries in the journal. Parrish’s mission departure was delayed until May. 5 Woodruff, Journal, 27 May 1836.   Comprehensive Works Cited Hide Works Cited Woodruff, Wilford. Journals, 1833–1898.

It was apparently during this delay that Parrish retrieved the history and the journal from Cowdery and added a final two months of material from the journal, 18 November 1835 through 18 January 1836, to the history—probably before leaving for his missionary assignment. Parrish made no additional entries to the journal before returning it to JS. Thus the journal ended with Cowdery’s entries.
Much of the material in the journal seems to have been dictated by JS to the scribe or recorded as JS spoke to various gatherings. For example, the entry for 21 January 1836 is apparently a dictation because it reports a vision seen only by JS. JS may have had the scribe read back his dictations to him in order to make corrections, as he had sometimes done six years earlier in dictating his translation of the Book of Mormon. In the 21 January entry, the scribe writes, “I am mistaken,” and a paragraph in the entry corrects a statement made earlier in the entry. A few days later, Parrish 10 Jan. 1803–3 Jan. 1877.

He explained, “Writing has a particular tendency to injure my lungs while I am under the influence of such a cough”—a possible indication that his scribal duties required reading aloud. 6 JS, Journal, 25 Jan. 1836.  
The journal reveals aspects not only of the inner spiritual life and the religious fellowship that JS shared with church members and leaders but also of his relations with adherents of other religious persuasions. Various entries describe his interactions with Presbyterians, Methodists, a Baptist, a Universalist, and a Unitarian. The journal records a visit JS received from two followers of the British religious reformer Edward Irving as well as a visit from JS’s contemporary Robert Matthews 1788–ca. 1841.

During his visit with Matthews, JS shared the foundational religious experiences of his youth, including rare accounts of his visit from the angel Moroni and of his first vision of Deity.
The journal also records several other revelations and visions. Of particular theological significance is the aforementioned 21 January 1836 vision of the “celestial kingdom” of heaven, with its revelation that “all who have died with[out] a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it, if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God.” 7 JS, Journal, 21 Jan. 1836.   This foreshadows the Latter-day Saint doctrine of redeeming the dead through vicarious ordinances.
A number of entries in this journal relate to JS’s revelatory translation of Egyptian writings. In July 1835, JS and associates had purchased from a Michael Chandler Ca. 1798–21 Oct. 1866.

Journal entries refer to them as the “records of antiquity,” the “Egyptian manuscripts,” the “Egyptian records,” the “sacred record,” the “ancient records,” the “records of Abraham,” or simply “the records.” JS’s efforts led to publication in 1842 of a work that he introduced as “purporting to be the writings of Abraham.” 8 “The Book of Abraham,” Times and Seasons,1 Mar. 1842, 3:703–706; 15 Mar. 1842, 3:719–722; 16 May 1842, 3:783–784 [Abraham 1–5].   Comprehensive Works Cited Hide Works Cited Times and Seasons.

After the House of the Lord was completed and dedicated, the anticipated solemn assembly was finally held, which included the ordinance of foot washing.

Gibbs, A Manual Hebrew and English Lexicon Including the Biblical Chaldee. Designed Particularly for Beginners, 2nd ed. (New Haven, CT: Hezekiah Howe, 1832). The copy owned by the Community of Christ has a binding that matches the Stuart grammar and an “FWC” endorsement inside the back cover. “Websters English Lexicon” refers to a reprinting of Noah Webster’s 1828 American Dictionary of the English Language—possibly one of the N. and J.

I then made the remarks above  stated; 130 This marriage solemnized by JS for Newel Knight—a friend from JS’s New York years—and Lydia Goldthwaite Bailey is the first known wedding performed by JS; ten more followed over the next two months.a Newel Knight recorded, “We received much Instruction from the Prophet concerning matrimony, & what the ancient order of God was, & what it must be again concerning marriage.”b A statement on marriage published in August 1835 stated that weddings could be performed by either priesthood officers or “other authority,”c but on this occasion JS emphasized priesthood authority. After Geauga County authorities refused to issue Sidney Rigdon a license to perform marriages, apparently no other Latter-day Saint priesthood holders applied in that county.d Ohio state law allowed for regularly ordained ministers to solemnize marriages with or without a license if they fulfilled the statutory requirement for recording.e Thus JS probably believed—with some justification—that he acted within his statutory rights in performing marriages. However, the church was not legally incorporated in the state of Ohio at this time.f  The arrest of Joseph Smith Sr., an ordained Latter-day Saint minister, in early 1838 on a charge of illegal performance of marriage suggests that the authority of Latter-day Saints to perform marriages in Ohio was still at least an open question at that time. The senior Smith was allowed to escape, and so the case did not come to trial.g   (aBradshaw, “Joseph Smith’s Performance of Marriages in Ohio,” 24; see also Hartley, “Newel and Lydia Bailey Knight’s Kirtland Love Story.”bKnight, Autobiography, [60]].c“Marriage,” ca.
